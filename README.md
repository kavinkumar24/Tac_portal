2. Server with database
   
## Scope:
1. This software system will serve as a portal for the Technical Approval Committee (TAC), enabling students to submit their projects and receive their rewards. From an administrative perspective, this system will provide a comprehensive analytical dashboard for project oversight.

The system will calculate the number of days between the approval date and the current date. If this duration is less than 30 days, a warning will be displayed indicating that students can claim only 30% of their rewards, which is contingent on the number of days since approval.
